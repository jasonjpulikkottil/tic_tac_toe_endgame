$ jupyter notebook

You can use Shell (Terminal) to open Jupyter Notebook with the command, Jupyter Notebook.

NOTE: If you get an error jupyter: command not found, this means that you have not activated the conda environment that you installed for this textbook. Be sure to activate the environment in the terminal using the command conda activate earth-analytics-python before running the jupyter notebook command.

When you type this command into the terminal, it will launch a local web server on your computer. This server runs the Jupyter Notebook interface.

You will notice that the Terminal is running commands to start your Jupyter Notebook session. Be sure to leave the Terminal open while you use Jupyter Notebook. It is running a local server for Jupyter Notebook so that you can interact with it in your web browser.

If your commands were successful, your default web browser will open with a new tab that displays your Jupyter Notebook dashboard.

The dashboard serves as a homepage for Jupyter Notebook. Its main purpose is to display the notebooks and files in the current directory.
